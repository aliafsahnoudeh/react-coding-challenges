# Todo List Application

Problem Statement:
Create a simple todo list application using React.js. The application should have the following features:

- Add Todo Item: There should be an input field and a button to add new todo items.
- Display Todo List: All todo items should be displayed in a list format.
- Mark as Completed: Each todo item should have a checkbox to mark it as completed.
- Delete Todo Item: Each todo item should have a delete button to remove it from the list.

Requirements:

Use functional components and React hooks (like useState).
Style the application minimally (just to make it look neat).
Bonus:

Implement a way to filter the todo list by completed and uncompleted items.


## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### Deployment

### `npm run build` fails to minify
